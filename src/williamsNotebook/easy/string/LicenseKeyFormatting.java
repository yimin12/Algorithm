* Description:
* 	You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only 
* 	alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.
*   Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group containsexactlyK 
*   characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain 
*   at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all 
*   lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.
*   Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.
*   Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4   Output:  "5F3Z-2E9W"
*   Explanation:
*   	The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters. Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
